# HeroBiz-Inspired
This project was designed using bootstrap 3.4.1, HTML, CSS and JQuery. 
It is a single paged website. 
Due to the large number of sections, section names were chosen based on some characteristics of the section in context to make it understandable and easily relatable.
Boostrap features like navbar, button, filter, carousel, pills, etc. were utilized.
AOS was utikized for some of the animation effects for viewing some sections. This can alos be removed by commenting on the AOS link in the head section. 
This webpage can be redesigned using bs5.2.1 also. 
Before viewing the webpage, ensure the entire content is downloaded to a folder called "HeroBiz Webpage" and this folder is in the same path with the downloaded bs 3.4.1 
(reference head section on how to link following the pathway on "index.html").
